There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows. 

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Heading ##
  > Name the product in a way the reader (i.e. your target customers) will understand.
  Let's Learn Colors

## Sub-Heading ##
  > Describe who the market for the product is and what benefit they get. One sentence only underneath the title.
  To aid parents with young children teach their child colors.

## Summary ##
  > Give a summary of the product and the benefit. Assume the reader will not read anything else so make this paragraph good.
 Let's Learn Colors will allow your toddler to learn their colors by having an assortment of colors displayed to them which, when clicked, will say the name of that color. Colors can be clicked as many times as the child wants, allowing them to practice saying the word and hearing it repeated back to them.

## Problem ##
  > Describe the problem your product solves.
  Parents attempt to teach colors to their children by showing them all sorts of different objects and saying the color of those objects. For example, showing them an apple and saying "red". But children can become confused because that same item is being called "apple" sometimes and "red" othertimes. Furthermore, we usually say something similar to "this is a red apple.". This causes a childs mind to look for everything red in sight, and then find which one is an apple, which can be a complicated task if there is a lot of red in the surrounding area.

## Solution ##
  > Describe how your product elegantly solves the problem.
  Let's Learn Colors will provide a tool that shows carefully selected images that convey a very specific color, along with a pronounciation of that color. The pronounciation will be said in a way that is much more easily understood by children by saying the item first and then color. E.g. "This apple is red." This way your child is not looking for all red items, and then finding an apple from them. But narrowing it down quickly to apples, and then finding the red out of the apples.

## Quote from You ##
  > A quote from a spokesperson in your company.
  "By using our product your child is going to learn their colors better, faster, and in a more enjoyable way than they would have been able to without Let's Learn Colors"

## How to Get Started ##
  > Describe how easy it is to get started.
  To get started, all you need to do is go to our website along with your child, create an account, and right away you'll be taken to a page where your child can start learning their colors.

## Customer Quote ##
  > Provide a quote from a hypothetical customer that describes how they experienced the benefit.
  "My daughter loves to play Let's Learn Colors. Before this she hardly knew her colors, but now she's a pro!"

## Closing and Call to Action ##
  > Wrap it up and give pointers where the reader should go next.
  Teaching your child their colors as soon as possible will give them a headstart in life. The simplest thing to do to help your child learn colors faster is using the item before the color in a sentence, which is what Let's Learn Colors will do.
