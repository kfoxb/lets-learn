Let's Learn Colors
To aid parents with young children teach their child colors.

Let's Learn Colors will allow your toddler to learn their colors by having an assortment of colors displayed to them which, when clicked, will say the name of that color. Colors can be clicked as many times as the child wants, allowing them to practice saying the word and hearing it repeated back to them.

Parents attempt to teach colors to their children by showing them all sorts of different objects and saying the color of those objects. For example, showing them an apple and saying "red". But children can become confused because that same item is being called "apple" sometimes and "red" othertimes. Furthermore, we usually say something similar to "this is a red square.". This causes a childs mind to look for everything red in sight, and then find which one is an apple, which can be a complicated task if there is a lot of red color in the surrounding area.

Let's Learn Colors will provide a tool that shows carefully selected images that convey a very specific color, along with a pronounciation of that color. The pronounciation will be said in a way that is much more easily understood by children by saying the item first and then color. E.g. "This square is red." This way your child is narrowing it down quickly to only items that are apples, and then finding the red one out of the those apples.
